```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.halysongoncalves</groupId>
  <artifactId>pugnotification</artifactId>

</dependency>
```
or Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.github.halysongoncalves:pugnotification:1.1.0'
```

# Introduction

You're probably tired of writing code to display notifications in your applications, the library abstracts all the notifications construction process for you in a single line of code. Magic? Lie? I summarize in: productivity.

```java
PugNotification.with(context)
    .load()
    .title(title)
    .message(message)
    .bigTextStyle(bigtext)
    .simple()
    .build();
```

Many common pitfalls in building cases are handled automatically by PugNotification:

Custom Notifications depend on RemoteViews and Android has RemoteView support for Api's below Jelly Bean.
Notifications without no messages and title does not make sense there.
In addition to these treatments, there are other held by Picasso Library Square:

Handling ImageView recycling and download cancelation in an adapter.
Complex image transformations with minimal memory use.
Automatic memory and disk caching.


# Simple Notification

Simple notification with just text and message.

```java
PugNotification.with(context)
    .load()
    .title(title)
    .message(message)
    .bigTextStyle(bigtext)
    .smallIcon(R.drawable.pugnotification_ic_launcher)
    .largeIcon(R.drawable.pugnotification_ic_launcher)
    .custom()
    .background(url)
    .build();
```


# Custom Notification

PugNotification supports placeholders if download the image in the background is not successful. The library already have a default placeholder size 622x384.

```java
PugNotification.with(context)
    .load()
    .title(title)
    .message(message)
    .bigTextStyle(bigtext)
    .smallIcon(R.drawable.pugnotification_ic_launcher)
    .largeIcon(R.drawable.pugnotification_ic_launcher)
    .custom()
    .background(url)
    .setPlaceholder(R.drawable.pugnotification_ic_placeholder)
    .build();  
```

Using the picasso library for working with images. The request will be repeated three times before the error placeholder is shown.


# ProGuard

If you use the Picasso to manage the download of the image, add the line below to your proguard file:

```
-dontwarn com.squareup.okhttp.**
```
